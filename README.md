## HiðŸ‘‹
I am Ashiq, an undergraduate physics and computer science major at the University of Maryland College Park. I am currently learning Ocaml and advanced Python. 
As a researcher of Team Aether, GEMSTONE, and UMD, I am currently working on developing a coding pipeline that constrains different parameters of the early universe.
